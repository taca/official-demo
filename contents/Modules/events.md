# Events

Here are some examples on how the calendar modules can be used. You can either use a big calendar view, a mini-calender as shown on the left side below the vertical navigation or an event-list shown at the bottom of the page. All of those offer you different options of with what, where, when and how to display the calendar.

To see some actual calendar entries click here to go to May 2013.
