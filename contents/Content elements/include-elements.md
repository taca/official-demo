# Include elements

The Include element could be seen as a kind of flexible copy and paste function. By creating an include element on a given page you can integrate a content element of any kind already existing on another page with all attributes such as CSS style. The output on the front end will be identical to the output of the original content element on its page. The content element to be displayed via the include element can be chosen in a drop-down menu containing all content elements used on the entire website.
