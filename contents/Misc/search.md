## Ways to search

### 1. KEYWORD SEARCH

This might be the default way to use a search engine. Simply enter one or more keywords and the search engine will return all pages that contain either all keywords (AND query) or at least one keyword (OR query). You can predefine the query type in the module configuration or you can change it dynamically by adding a checkbox named "query_type" to the search form.

### 2. WILDCARD SEARCH

By default, the search engine searches for exact keywords only. This means that a search for music will not return pages containing the words musical or musician. However, if you want to search for all words that begin with music, you can add an asterisk (*) after the keyword (music* instead of music). Of course, you can also put the wildcard in front of a keyword.

### 3. PHRASE SEARCH

Sometimes you only need results that include an exact phrase. E.g. searching for music academy would also return the page of a sports academy announcing an event with music and buffet. To narrow your results, simply put quotation marks around your search term ("music academy" instead of music academy) and the search engine will only return pages that contain the exact phrase.

### 4. FORCING A KEYWORD

This feature is particularly useful when you are searching for multiple keyword (OR query) but still want ensure that a page contains a certain keyword. To force a keyword, put a plus (+) in front of it (without space). E.g. if you want to know about college fees or university fees, you are basically looking for pages that contain either the word college or university and the word fees. Therefor your search term should be school college +fees.

### 5. EXCLUDING A KEYWORD

To exclude a keyword, put a minus (-) in front of it. Thus, pages containing this keyword will not be returned. E.g. if you want to learn everything about Music Academy that has nothing to do with its campus or its courses, you should search for "music academy" -campus -courses.
